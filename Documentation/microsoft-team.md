# Microsoft Team Onboarding

If you are new to Microsoft, you will need to onboard into various GitHub projects in order to get your work done.

## Set up Your Account

1. **Link** your GitHub account to your Microsoft login
    * Follow steps on https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/link
    * Note: This will add you as a member into [Microsoft organization](https://github.com/orgs/Microsoft/people)
2. Publicly associate yourself with **Microsoft organization**
    * Go to https://github.com/orgs/Microsoft/people
    * Search for your GH login in the list
    * Choose `Public` from the drop-down list of organization visibility
    * Note: Everyone will now see a Microsoft badge on your GH profile in Organizations section on the left side
3. Join **dotnet organization**
    * Go to https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com
		* Select `DotNet` on the right side and click `Join`
4. Publicly associate yourself with **dotnet organization**

    * Note: Everyone will now see a dotnet badge on your GH profile in Organizations section on the left side
5. Update your profile
    * Go to https://github.com/settings/profile
    * Match your **Name** on GitHub with full name in address book (so other employees can find you and contact you internally when needed)
    * Set `@Microsoft` as your **Company**
    * Upload your **picture**, ideally showing your face
        * Hint: You can grab your GAL picture from https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com
6. **Join GitHub teams** to gain read-write access to repos
    * Request team membership via https://repos.opensource.microsoft.com/teams
    * Find the right teams - e.g. `dotnet-coreclr`, `dotnet-corefx`, etc.
