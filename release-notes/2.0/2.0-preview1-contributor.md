# Contributions to .NET Core 2.0 Preview 1

We're still working out the best way to present contributors and trying to be as accurate as possible. The list below is generated with the following command listed below in an attempt to capture all contributions which have gone into .NET Core 2.0 Preview 1. Where multiple email addresses were returned for a single person, the counts were aggregated with the email address reported the most commits.

```bash
git shortlog -sne --no-merges --until release/2.0.0@{2017-05-05} --committer="dotnet-bot" --invert-grep
```

When you navigate to a contributors commit page, the results are not filtered by release so more commits than are listed below will be shown.
