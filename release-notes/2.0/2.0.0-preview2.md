# Release Notes

## .NET Core 2.0.0 Preview 2 released 6/28/2017

.NET Core 2.0.0 Preview 2 and SDK 2.0.0 Preview 2 are available for download and testing. These can be found on [.NET Core Preview 2](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core/preview) or the [Preview 2 download page](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/download-archives/2.0.0-preview2-download.md).

The .NET Core SDK 2.0.0-Preview 2 includes .NET Core 2.0.0-Preview 2 runtime so downloading the runtime packages separately is not needed when installing the SDK.

A [number of improvements](2.0.0-preview2-commit.md) have been made since Preview 1 by an [incredible list of folks](2.0.0-preview2-contributor.md). You can see details for other areas of the release in the [.NET Blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/) and have a look at [.NET Core 2.0.0 Preview 2 Known Issues](2.0.0-preview2-known-issues.md) document as there are a few things to be aware of before installing.

You're feedback is important and appreciated. We've created [dotnet/core #711](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/711) for your questions and comments.
