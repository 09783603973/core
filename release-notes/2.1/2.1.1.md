# .NET Core June 2018 Update - June 21, 2018

.NET Core 2.1.1 is available for download and usage in your environment. Have a look at the [Known Issues](2.1.1-known-issues.md) document as there are a few things to be aware of before installing. A [changelist](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1.1-commit.md) for the entire 2.1 development cycle is also available. This does not include ASP.NET Core or Entity Framework Core.

The .NET Core SDK 2.1 includes .NET Core 2.1 Runtime so downloading the runtime packages separately is not needed when installing the SDK. After installing the .NET Core SDK 2.1, running `dotnet --version` will show that you're running version `2.1.301` of the .NET Core tools.

`dotnet --info` has been greatly enhanced in .NET Core 2.1 and now provides detailed information on installed .NET Core components.

Your feedback is important and appreciated. We've created an issue at [dotnet/core #1719](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/1719) for your questions and comments.

## Docker Images

The [.NET Core Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) have been updated for this release. Look for the updated images for .NET Core 2.1.1 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.301 and read ["Staying up-to-date with .NET Container Images"](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/) for details and insights into using the .NET Core images.

## Azure AppServices

* Deployment of .NET Core 2.1.1 to Azure App Services has begun. It will be available in limited regions today and expected worldwide by the end of the week.

### Supported Linux version changes

No changes in supported versions this month. Ubuntu 17.10 will reach end-of-life in July and will be removed from the supported list at that time.

## Notable Changes in 2.1

### Linux installers

#### Installer changes

The .NET Core 2.1 release included Linux installer updates to support package manager update (eg `apt-get update`) functionality. With the release of 2.1.1, we can now see how it works. Each package manager has its own dialect and idiosyncracies so take the time to look into the particulars of your system. Here's an example using `dnf` on a Fedora 28 system.

First, you need to update the package database to determine if there are any updates. `dnf check-update` is useful in that it will provide a list of available updates without trying to install anything. To trim the list, we can do something like this ...

```bash
$sudo dnf check-update | grep dotnet
dotnet-sdk-2.1.x86_64                  2.1.301-1                        packages-microsoft-com-prod
```

Now that we know there is an update available, our system can be upgraded with the following. If this is the first install, you would usd `install` rather than `upgrade`.

```bash
$sudo dnf upgrade dotnet-sdk-2.1

Is this ok [y/N]:

The package manager will install the updated version and remove the previous from your system. This is a change from previous installations which would leave the old versions behind. If a previous release of 2.1 is needed, it can be installed by explicitly referencing the version. Sticking with the Fedora example, you would use `dnf --showduplicates.`

```bash
$dnf --showduplicates list dotnet-sdk-2.1

Installed Packages
dotnet-sdk-2.1.x86_64                              2.1.301-1                               @packages-microsoft-com-prod

Available Packages
dotnet-sdk-2.1.x86_64                              2.1.300-1                               packages-microsoft-com-prod
dotnet-sdk-2.1.x86_64                              2.1.301-1                               @packages-microsoft-com-prod
```

You can see that 2.1.300 and 2.1.301 are available and 2.1.301 is currently installed. `dnf install dotnet-sdk-2.1-2.1.300-1` will downgrade the system from 2.1.301 to 2.1.300.
