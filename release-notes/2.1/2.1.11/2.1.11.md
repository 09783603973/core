# .NET Core 2.1.11 Update - May 14, 2019

.NET Core 2.1.11 is available for [download](2.1.11-download.md) and usage in your environment. This release includes .NET Core 2.1.11, ASP.NET Core 2.1.11 and the .NET Core SDK.

**NOTE:** If you are a Visual Studio user, there are MSBuild version requirements so use only the .NET Core SDK supported for each Visual Studio version. If you use other development environments, we recommend using the latest SDK release.
