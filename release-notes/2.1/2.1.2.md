# .NET Core July 2018 Update - July 10, 2018

.NET Core 2.1.2 is available for download and usage in your environment. Have a look at the [Known Issues](2.1.2-known-issues.md) document as there are a few things to be aware of before installing. A [changelist](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1.2-commit.md) for the entire 2.1 development cycle is also available. This does not include ASP.NET Core or Entity Framework Core.

## Blog Round up

* [.NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/)

The .NET Core SDK 2.1 includes .NET Core 2.1 Runtime so downloading the runtime packages separately is not needed when installing the SDK. After installing the .NET Core SDK 2.1, running `dotnet --version` will show that you're running version `2.1.302` of the .NET Core tools.

`dotnet --info` has been greatly enhanced in .NET Core 2.1 and now provides detailed information on installed .NET Core components.

Your feedback is important and appreciated. We've created an issue at [dotnet/core #XXXX](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/XXXX) for your questions and comments.

## Docker Images

The [.NET Core Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/microsoft/dotnet/) have been updated for this release. Look for the updated images for .NET Core 2.1.2 and .NET Core SDK 2.1.301 and read ["Staying up-to-date with .NET Container Images"](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2018/06/18/staying-up-to-date-with-net-container-images/) for details and insights into using the .NET Core images.

## Azure AppServices

* Deployment of .NET Core 2.1.2 to Azure App Services has begun. It will be available in limited regions today and expected worldwide by the end of the week.

See [.NET Core Supported OS Lifecycle Policy](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/os-lifecycle-policy.md) to learn about Windows, macOS and Linux versions that are supported for each .NET Core release.

Maybe a bit about 2.1 going LTS in the next few months and 2.0 going EOL in October.
