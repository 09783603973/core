# Release Notes

## .NET Core March 2017 Update - 1.0.4 Released 3/7/2017

.NET Core 1.0.4 and SDK 1.0.1 are available for download from our [site](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core). Have a look at the [announcement blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/) for details and great context around the release.

### .NET Core SDK 1.0.0 and 1.0.1

**.NET Core SDK 1.0.0** is releasing with Visual Studio 2017. The [announcement blog](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/) linked above as well as the [RC4 blog post](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2017/02/07/announcing-net-core-tools-updates-in-vs-2017-rc) have great details on what is available in this final release.

**.NET Core SDK 1.0.1**, available for download from the [.NET Core download page](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core), also includes support for Fedora 24 and OpenSUSE 42.1.

### Distro Updates

A little more about Distros. Each Distro version has a lifecycle at the end of which the maintainers cease providing support and updates. When a Distro comes to the end of its life as defined by the maintainer, we will also adjust the supported list for .NET Core. Support will not be actively blocked so .NET Core will likely continue to work but no support or updates for .NET Core will be offered.

Support for the following distros have been withdrawn to align with the respective OS support policy.

* Fedora 23
* OpenSUSE 13.2
