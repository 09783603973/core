### .NET Core API

Changes to the .NET Core API surface are can bee seen in the [1.0-1.1-api-diff](1.0-1.1-api-diff/1.0-1.1-api-diff.md)

### WCF

XmlSerializer, DataContractSerializer, and DataContractJsonSerializer can now serialize or deserialize objects at runtime without using IL emit or code generation. Prior to this release, in Universal Windows Platform (UWP) applications, these serializers can only be generated at compile time by .NET Native toolchain. This new feature, therefore, is especially useful for UWP applications in scenarios where pre-generated serializers at compile time is hard to achieve when runtime information is required for seraization. For example, constructor XmlSerializer.ctor(Type,â€‚XmlRootAttribute) is now supported on UWP.

### ASP.NET Core
